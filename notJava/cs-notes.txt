0. How do you use local variables?
- declaration within a block
- no access (don't put public or pricate)
- local scope (where a variable is known)
	- this means it's only accessible within the block you declare it

1. How do you use while loops?
- iteration: the act of repeating a process
- the results of one iteration are used to start the next iteration

order for writing a while loop
0. body 
1. looping constant, while (boolean expression)
2. update (so the expression eventually becomes false)
3. initialization (local variables needed)

What characterizes...

0. while-style definitions?
- On each iteration, accumulate the current # in the total.
- when describing, use phrases like while, until, next, for each

1. recursive definitions?
- define a large version of an entity in terms of a smaller version of the same entity
- ends with a smallest version which is defined without recourse to any smaller version of the entity
- when describing, mention
	a) the size of the problem (n)
	b) the next smaller-sized problem (n-1)
	c) the smallest problem (0 or 1)
