# SuperFly: implement a list of diverse types without polymorphism

A fork of 54_SuperArray_v0, aimed at understaning how such a list
might be programmed without the benefits of polymorphism. 

mild historical joke: since the programming style dates from the the 1970s, the name 
refers to the
[classic blaxploitation film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Fly_%28film%29) 
from 1972 and 
[Curtis Mayfield's music for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cmo6MRYf5g).
