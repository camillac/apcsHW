# abstract iteration into the Linked List ADT

An initial cut at abstracting the concept of iteration
into the the Linked List collection, rather than
leaving it in each user-programmer's code.

New methods in `LinkedList`:
 * `nextElement`
 * `initIteration`
 * `hasNextElement`

* Herb Ellis
* Buddy Rich

The Gershwins wrote the tune for Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in 
[_Shall We Dance_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZ3fjQa5Hls). 
Among the dancing those two gave us, 
this looks even less possible than most.
